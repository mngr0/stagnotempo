# stagnotempo
timer for a raspberry. configurable via web-interface

Django project
making use of threading and RPi.GPIO


Deployed with uwsgi and nginx (whose configuration file can be found in the deploy folder)
follow the instruction in the webpage I stole from the web and saved in the deploy folder.
